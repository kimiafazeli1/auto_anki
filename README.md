## Future RoadMap

#### Build a browser extension with the current functionality

- A browser extension which will extract contents of the current webpage which the user is on and produce a new deck of anki cards based on the material.

#### Improve word extraction logic

- Currently Spacy is being used to extract noun phrases from each slide/page of the document. Then the high frequency noun phrases are calculated and used in the final search query. However this causes an issue when every slide has the documentâ€™s author name and email address listed. The author name is considered as a noun phrase, and since it appears on every slide has a high frequency, and thus appears on the final search query.
